## Experimental API Wrapper for Epic Hire

I'm not sure if this is the best way to do it. It's based quite heavily off of the nyxx api wrapper, but many modifications will need to be made such that it's not too dependent on the socket.

TODO: I think I can just make token / non-token auth a different type, and have the manager extend something different.
